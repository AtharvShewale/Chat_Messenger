# Chat Messenger (Java)

##  Project Overview
Chat Messenger is a Java-based **server–client console chat application** developed using **socket programming**.  
It enables real-time text communication between a server and a client running on the same machine using `localhost`.

This project demonstrates core Java networking concepts such as client–server architecture, sockets, input/output streams, and multi-terminal communication.

### 🔹 Prerequisites
- Java JDK installed
- Command Prompt / Terminal
- Two terminal windows

1. Open **two separate terminals**:
   - **Terminal 1** → Server  
   - **Terminal 2** → Client

2. Navigate to the project folder in both terminals:
   - first compile Server.java
   - then compile Client.java
     
3. Run
   -⚠️ Important: Always run the Server first, then the Client. Both should use the same localhost address.
