<<<<<<< HEAD
##  Project Overview
Chat Messenger is a Java-based server–client console chat application developed using **socket programming**.  
It enables real-time text communication between a server and a client running on the same network (localhost).

This project demonstrates core networking concepts in Java, including sockets, input/output streams, and multi-terminal communication.

##  Features
- Real-time messaging between server and client
- Console-based user interface
- Uses Java Socket Programming
- Platform-independent
- Simple and lightweight implementation

---

##  Technologies Used
- Java
- Socket Programming
- TCP/IP Networking
- Input/Output Streams

##  How to Run the Project

###  Prerequisites
- Java JDK installed
- Command Prompt / Terminal
- Two terminal windows

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Open Two Terminals
- **Terminal 1** → Server
- **Terminal 2** → Client

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Navigate to Project Folder
In both terminals:
```bash
cd E:\Projects\Chat_Messenger
=======
A **server-client console chat application** in Java using **socket programming**.

---

## Features
- Real-time messaging between server and client
- Simple console interface
- Platform-independent

---

## How to Run
1. Open terminal in project folder.
2. Compile files:

javac Server.java
javac Client.java

> **Important:** Run the **Server first**, then the **Client**. Both use the same `localhost` address.

### Step 1: Open two separate terminals
- **Terminal 1** → for **Server**  
- **Terminal 2** → for **Client**

### Step 2: Compile the Java files
In both terminals (or just once), navigate to the project folder and compile:

```bash
cd E:\Projects\Chat_Messenger
javac Server.java
javac Client.java
