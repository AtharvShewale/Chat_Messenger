# Chat Messenger (Java)

## Project Overview
Chat Messenger is a Java-based server–client console chat application developed using socket programming in Java.
It enables real-time text communication between a server and a client on localhost.

## Features
- Real-time messaging
- Console-based interface
- Java Socket Programming
- Lightweight and simple

## How to Run
1. Open two terminals (cmd)


2. Compile both the files on separate cmd  side by side   
  - Server.java
  - Client.java

3. Run
 - Run the Server.java first
 - Then run the Client.java

⚠️ Important: Always start the Server before running the Client, and ensure both use the same IP address (default: localhost) and port number. Running the client first or using different network configurations will result in a connection error.
